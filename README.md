# propacity-assignment
I have used html css and javascript to build this project. I have the landing page, and on page load, I have shown the modal where the user can submit the form so the form
will be stored in Google Sheets and on the server. I have added the alert If both the response is successful then it will navigate to the greeting page if any one of them is not a success there will be an alert 
that data is not saved successfully.
